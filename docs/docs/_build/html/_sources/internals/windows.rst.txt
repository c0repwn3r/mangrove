A note on Windows compatability
-------------------------------

One of the :ref:`Mangrove design principles <internals_intro>` has always been to make Mangrove cross-platform.
Originally, the plan was to make Mangrove support Windows. However, as the project has moved on, the maintainers have realized it is not worth our time to add support for Windows in these initial stages.
Windows support **is** on the roadmap, but it is quite a long ways down.

PR's always welcome! If you wish to do the work on getting Mangrove Windows-ified, we will do our best to maintain it.

If you wish to port Mangrove to windows but do not wish to merge it with the main project, contact a member of the core team directly to discuss official project endorsement.
