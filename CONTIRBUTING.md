# Mangrove Contributor Guidelines

1. Keep up to the code quality standard. No warnings are best.
2. If you're making a PR, please include tests if it is a part of libmangrove. Core team, please add tests eventually.
3. Keep up with commit naming style.

>`[stuff_worked_on/in_order_of_most_work][optional_type_of_work_done] helpful commit message`
> 
>For example, a recent commit:
`[mangrove-cli/libmangrove] fixups to associated key precedence`
would indicate that `mangrove-cli` and `libmangrove` had work done, with most work being done on `mangrove-cli`, and the work done was `fixups to associated key precedense`.

4. Run tests before every commit. If some fail, that's okay, but specify it in the commit name.
5. Aim for no warnings.
